Katie holds a bachelors in Cognitive Science from NYU. With an equal passion for the arts, Katie worked in production and operations for off-broadway shows and start-ups. Inspired by the way that data is shaping our land scape, she took the plunge and attended Metis' data science boot camp. She is eager to explore how data can help us learn more about ourselves, as well as how we interact with each other and our environment. Katie believes in the power of narrative and endeavors to maximize that last mile of the process to turn insights into actions. She lives in the :cityscape: with her various :cactus: babies.
